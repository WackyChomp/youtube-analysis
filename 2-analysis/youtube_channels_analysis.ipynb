    "## 1.1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "---YouTube Background info---\n",
    "\n",
    "YouTube had it's humble beginnings starting out in\n",
    "\n",
    "The first video uploaded was [Me at the zoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw). \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "---My Motivations---\n",
    "\n",
    "I have been utilizing YouTube as a main source of entertainment and educational content for over a decade. This is my first instance of taking a deeper look at the statistics of top content creators I have followed previously, ocassionally, or currently. This project explores the educational and entertainment content from 10-20 successful YouTube channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will strengthen my understanding and explores the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning Youtube API | Navigating documentation | Obtaining video data\n",
    "- Analyzing common misconceptions of becoming <b>\"successful\"</b> on YouTube\n",
    "- Identify trending topics through Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3. Approach\n",
    "1. Obtain meta data with Youtube API from 10-15 channels in entertainment and education niches\n",
    "2. Cleaning raw data and develop additional features for analysis (Pandas)\n",
    "3. Exploratory analysis with data visualizations (Seaborn | Matplotlib)\n",
    "4. Conclusions / Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4. Data Source\n",
    "- Existing datasets online do not have the necessary information to perform exploratory analysis in this project. Some reasons include:\n",
    "  - Outdated information\n",
    "- Currently YouTube API service retains information from the past 30 days. The only way\n",
    "to have more statistics beyond 30 days is to continuously scrape data until the information is required in the future.\n",
    " - The downside of this approach growing collection of data\n"
